This app design is for a class project I did in a human computer iteration class at Drake University. We were tasked with figuring out a solution on how online classes could be improved. As a group we conducted interviews on parents and college-age students. From the information we gathered, we created personas, brainstormed ideas, and then created storyboards over those ideas. Next, we picked the best idea based on the storyboards and created a low-fidelity paper prototype. Then we created user aspect reports (UARs) for the prototype. Using the UARs I created the high-fidelity prototype using Adobe XD. My group members then completed a heuristic evaulation and a cognitive walkthough of the the prototype.
