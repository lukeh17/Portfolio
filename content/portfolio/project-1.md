Weiner Run is a mobile game developed in Unity and C#. The game includes a global weinerboard, costumes, powerups, and a jumping hotdog. I monitized the game with ads and created a currency with pickles to buy the costumes. I created all of the art for the game and in the future I plan to republish the game to the Google Play Store and eventually publish to the Apple App Store.
